# Project Brief

This project, "Loota," is a Next.js application designed to facilitate treasure hunts. It integrates with Prisma for database management and likely involves location-based services given the presence of `MapComponent.tsx` and `ProximityComponent.tsx`. The application also includes API endpoints for managing hunts, participants, and user registration, as well as a universal link generation feature.
